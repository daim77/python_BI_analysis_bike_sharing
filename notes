============================================
Features/Characteristics of Demand

The following are the main features or characteristics of demand that the marketer must keep in mind while analyzing the demand for its product:

The demand is the specific quantity that a consumer is willing to purchase. Thus, it is expressed in numbers.
The demand must mean the demand per unit of time, per month, per week, per day.
The demand is always at a price, e. any change in the price of a commodity will bring about a certain change in its quantity demanded.
The demand is always in a market, a place where a set of buyers and sellers meet. The market needs not to be a geographical area.

==============
bike dates and weather dates must be same - select data
own hire duration calculation - I have durations 1s longer
========================================
BIKES
'started_at', 'ended_at', 'start_station_id', 'start_station_latitude', 'start_station_longitude', 'end_station_id',
'end_station_latitude', 'end_station_longitude'

WETHER
'date', 'time', 'temp', 'feels', 'wind', 'gust', 'rain', 'humidity', 'cloud', 'vis'

===== BASIC STAT =====
199                 stations
340986              number of hire acts
776 days 14:59:20   measured period
40 hire acts        less than 111 times per measured period (less than ones per week)

station ID 250 - total the most accumulated bycicles

=====ELEVATION=====
Data loaded from OpenStreetMap with its API
delta ELEV calculated: coding: uphill if END > START
delta ELEV histogram - majority of journeys are done fith delta elev <-35m, +23m>
MAX delta ELEV: 102m
MIN delta ELEV: -104m

====count====
distance, bearing - simple calculation EARTH == ideal globe

3 values are extreme. End station lies in Liverpool and distances are 250km!!!
Length of city is approx 15km
50788 journeys => START/END same point coding as 999 for heading value

histogram dist, duration, bearing
majority journeys to 2500s / 41min
majority journeys low distances
majority journeys towards see => downhill

## column day_of_week added
coding: 0 - Monday, 6 - Sunday

group by month:
frequent useage from May till October
3 times less during winter period
during winter period approx 13k rides per day regardless weekday
from May till October rides 3 times more frequent and Saturday 4 times

===== WEATHER ====
DEPENDENCIES
WIND and GUST => probably only wind is important
TEMP and FEELS => probably only temp is important

compare journey bearing to wind direction

count most used stations then top10 and show their elevation
