Features/Characteristics of Demand

The following are the main features or characteristics of demand that the marketer must keep in mind while analyzing the demand for its product:

The demand is the specific quantity that a consumer is willing to purchase. Thus, it is expressed in numbers.
The demand must mean the demand per unit of time, per month, per week, per day.
The demand is always at a price, e. any change in the price of a commodity will bring about a certain change in its quantity demanded.
The demand is always in a market, a place where a set of buyers and sellers meet. The market needs not to be a geographical area.
